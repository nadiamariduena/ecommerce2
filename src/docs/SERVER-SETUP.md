# INSTALL MONGO ðŸŒ±

- SINCE its the second time i repeat the first steps of the tutorial, I already had the data base and
  i didn't have to repeat all the steps

<!-- - But i have a question, can i have two user names and 2 passwords for different prOjects
  or do i have to use the same for all of them? -->

<br>
<br>

### MONGO DB CONNECTION 

- replace this and add the STRING LINK here:

```javascript
//before
.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/test"
// after
.connect("mongodb+srv://root:<password>@cluster0.ik0cr.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```
<br>

##### It should look like this:

```javascript
mongoose
  .connect(
    "mongodb+srv://root:<password>@cluster0.ik0cr.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority",
    {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    }
  ) //add this
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connected");
  });
```

##### Notice the root

- This root has to be added inside the .env file

```javascript
 .connect(
    "mongodb+srv://root:<password>

```

##### Like so

- all this information was added while creating the cluster, only the "ecommerce" isnt clear from where he is adding it, but i guess it s the database he is going to create, lets see.

```javascript
PORT = 2000;
// THE following 3 lines are connected to the cluster
MONGO_DB_USER = root;
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD = admin * 354;
MONGO_DB_DATABASE = ecommerce;
```

#####NOW add the user, password and database. REPLACE the following:

```javascript
- root:<password>
- cluster0.ik0cr.mongodb
- <dbname>?retryWrites

```

##### IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

- DONT FORGET to add the template literals (``) to introduce the STRING LINK

```javascript
// MONGODB CONNECTION

mongoose
  .connect(
    `mongodb+srv://${process.env.MONGO_DB_USER}:${process.env.MONGO_DB_PASSWORD}@cluster0.ik0cr.mongodb.net/${process.env.MONGO_DB_DATABASE}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`,
    {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    }
  )
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connected");
  });
```

##### NOW TEST THE SERVER

- npm start

- You should have something like this:

```javascript
// RESULT ON THE CONSOLE
server is running on port 2000
Database connected


```

### CONGRATS!!! you have succesfully connected to the ATLAS ðŸŒ´
